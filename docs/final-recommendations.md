## 1. Speech Architecture Decision: Pipeline vs S2S

### What We Evaluated

Two approaches exist for voice AI:

**Option A — STT → LLM → TTS (Modular Pipeline)**
```
Candidate Audio → [Sarvam STT] → Text → [GPT-4o] → Text → [Sarvam TTS] → AI Audio
```

**Option B — Speech-to-Speech (S2S)**
```
Candidate Audio → [OpenAI Realtime / Gemini Live] → AI Audio
```

### Decision: ✅ STT + LLM + TTS Pipeline

| Reason | Why It Matters for Interviews |
|---|---|
| **Transcripts are mandatory** | Recruiters must review what candidates said; S2S has no native text access |
| **Full LLM control** | Inject job description, resume, scoring rubric into any prompt |
| **Cost** | S2S streaming costs 5–10× more than modular pipeline at scale |
| **Structured output** | GPT-4o reliably returns evaluation JSON; S2S is weaker for structured tasks |
| **Debuggability** | You can inspect every STT/LLM output step; S2S is a black box |
| **Latency is acceptable** | 1.5–2s response gap on a phone interview feels natural |
| **Indian language accuracy** | Sarvam codemix is purpose-built; S2S models under-trained on Marathi+Hindi mix |

### When would S2S make sense (not this project)?
- Extremely latency-sensitive casual voice chat (gaming, social apps)
- Demo or MVP needing the quickest integration
- Primary language is English only, no Marathi code-switching required

---

### 🔴 If We Had Chosen S2S — Full Consequences

**Provider choice**: Gemini Live (best for Indian multilingual S2S) or OpenAI Realtime (best reasoning). Sarvam has **no S2S model** — they only offer Saaras (STT) + Bulbul (TTS).

**What breaks or gets harder:**

#### ❌ No transcripts by default
S2S models do not produce text as output — they produce audio directly. You must explicitly hook into `TranscriptionFrame` events in Pipecat to capture text. Without this, you have no record of what the candidate said — which is unusable for a screening interview.

```python
# Extra code required to capture transcripts from S2S:
class TranscriptSaver(FrameProcessor):
    async def process_frame(self, frame, direction):
        if isinstance(frame, TranscriptionFrame):
            await self.save_to_db(frame.text)  # manually wired
        await self.push_frame(frame, direction)
```

#### ❌ Gemini Live: 15-minute session hard limit
Gemini Live's audio-only sessions **expire after 15 minutes** without context window compression enabled. A 45-minute interview would require:
- Context compression configuration
- At least 3–4 WebSocket reconnections
- Session resumption token management (valid for 2 hours)
- Code to handle mid-interview reconnection gracefully

OpenAI Realtime does not have this specific limit, but its WebSocket connection must be managed carefully over 45 minutes.

#### ❌ Context lives on the provider's server
With S2S, the conversation history is stored on OpenAI's or Google's servers inside the active WebSocket session. When the session ends — context is gone. You cannot:
- Inspect what the LLM is "thinking"
- Modify the context mid-interview
- Use Pipecat's built-in summarization (`enable_context_summarization`)
- Use Mem0 natively for cross-round memory (must be manually injected at session start)

#### ❌ No LLM control for structured scoring
S2S models are optimized for conversational flow, not for following strict interview rubrics or returning structured JSON at the end of a session. GPT-4o in pipeline mode reliably returns:
```json
{"overall_score": 7.5, "technical_score": 8, "recommendation": "Proceed to Round 2"}
```
S2S models can do this too, but it requires custom function-calling hooks and is significantly less reliable.

#### ❌ Marathi+Hindi+English code-switching is unreliable
OpenAI Realtime and Gemini Live handle Hinglish (Hindi+English) reasonably well. However:
- Rapid Marathi+English script switching causes higher error rates
- Both models default toward English-accented output when uncertain
- No `codemix` mode equivalent — language detection is automatic but less controllable
- Sarvam's purpose-built training on Indian audio cannot be matched by global S2S models

#### ✅ What S2S does better
- **Latency**: 350–500ms vs 1.2–2.2s for pipeline. Noticeably snappier.
- **Naturalness**: Preserves intonation end-to-end; no TTS "flatness"
- **Barge-in**: Native interrupt support — candidate can cut the AI off mid-sentence
- **Integration simplicity**: Fewer components to wire up for a demo or MVP

#### Summary: S2S Trade-off for This Project

| | STT+LLM+TTS Pipeline ✅ | S2S ❌ |
|---|---|---|
| Transcript access | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Requires extra hooks |
| 45-min session support | ✅ Native | ❌ Gemini: 15-min limit; OpenAI: manageable |
| Marathi code-switching | ✅ Sarvam codemix | ⚠️ Inconsistent |
| Structured evaluation JSON | ✅ Reliable | ⚠️ Needs custom function hooks |
| Cross-round memory (Mem0) | ✅ Native Pipecat | ❌ Manual injection at session start |
| Latency | ⚠️ 1.2–2.2s | ✅ 350–500ms |
| Cost at production scale | ✅ Lower | ❌ 5–10× higher |
| Vendor lock-in | ✅ Low | ❌ Locked to OpenAI or Google |
| Debuggability | ✅ Full visibility | ❌ Black box |

> **Bottom line**: S2S would make the interview feel more natural and responsive, but it breaks transcripts, structured scoring, Marathi code-switching reliability, and 45-minute session continuity. For a screening interview product, pipeline is the right choice.

## 2. Transport Layer: How the Audio Gets to Pipecat

### Our Use Case
- Recruiter triggers outbound call via React Native app → REST API
- AI agent calls the candidate's Indian mobile/landline
- Candidate answers → audio streams to Pipecat → AI responds back via phone

---

### ⚠️ Important: Twilio ≠ Pipecat Transport

This is the most common confusion. Let's be precise:

| Term | What it is | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Twilio** | A telephony company (cloud service) | Makes the PSTN phone call to the candidate |
| **`FastAPIWebsocketTransport`** | A **Pipecat transport class** | Manages the WebSocket connection between Twilio and your FastAPI server |
| **`TwilioFrameSerializer`** | A **Pipecat serializer class** | Translates Twilio's audio format ↔ Pipecat's internal format |

**Twilio is not a Pipecat transport class.** It is the telephony provider that sends audio to your server via WebSocket. The Pipecat classes that handle this are `FastAPIWebsocketTransport` (the transport) + `TwilioFrameSerializer` (the serializer). Both are always used together for any PSTN phone call.

```
Candidate's phone → Twilio (PSTN) → WebSocket → FastAPIWebsocketTransport
                                                          ↓
                                                  TwilioFrameSerializer
                                                  (decodes Twilio's format)
                                                          ↓
                                                  Pipecat Pipeline
                                                  (VAD → STT → LLM → TTS)
```

**You cannot use `TwilioFrameSerializer` without `FastAPIWebsocketTransport`.**
**You cannot use `FastAPIWebsocketTransport` alone for Twilio** — without the serializer, Pipecat won't understand Twilio's JSON message format.

They are always paired:
```python
# These two always go together for PSTN calls:
transport = FastAPIWebsocketTransport(websocket=ws, params=FastAPIWebsocketParams(
    serializer=TwilioFrameSerializer(...)   # ← plugged in here
))
```

---

### 🥇 #1 — Twilio (Programmable Voice + Media Streams)

**What it does:**
- Twilio dials the candidate's phone via PSTN (any Indian number — Jio, Airtel, Vi, landline)
- Once the call is answered, Twilio opens a WebSocket to your FastAPI server and streams audio in real-time (8kHz µ-law G.711)
- Your Pipecat pipeline processes audio and streams the AI's response back through the same WebSocket
- Twilio plays the audio to the candidate and hangs up when done

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Outbound PSTN calls to any phone number worldwide
- ✅ WebSocket Media Streams — real-time bidirectional audio
- ✅ REST API to initiate, monitor, and terminate calls
- ✅ India phone number (DID) support — local caller ID
- ✅ Pipecat integration via `TwilioFrameSerializer` (official, documented)
- ✅ DTMF support (touch-tone input if needed)
- ✅ Call recording via Twilio API
- ✅ Webhooks for call status (ringing, connected, completed, failed)

**Why Twilio is #1:**
- Most mature PSTN provider with the widest global coverage and India reliability
- Has the most Pipecat examples and community support
- Single REST call to start an interview: `twilio.calls.create(to=candidate_phone, from_=our_number, url=twiml_url)`
- Handles everything about the call — your backend only processes audio

**Limitations:**
- Higher cost for India outbound ($0.0135–0.091/min) — see Plivo below for savings
- Manual TRAI compliance setup required (AI disclosure, DNC scrubbing)
- Audio quality capped at 8kHz µ-law (telephone quality) — no HD audio

**India pricing:**

| Call Type | Rate/min |
|---|---|
| Outbound to India mobile | $0.0135 – $0.091 |
| Outbound to India landline | $0.0135 |
| India DID number (monthly) | $2.00/month |

**Pipecat integration:**
```python
from pipecat.transports.network.fastapi_websocket import FastAPIWebsocketTransport, FastAPIWebsocketParams
from pipecat.serializers.twilio import TwilioFrameSerializer

serializer = TwilioFrameSerializer(
    stream_sid=stream_sid, call_sid=call_sid,
    account_sid=TWILIO_SID, auth_token=TWILIO_TOKEN
)
transport = FastAPIWebsocketTransport(
    websocket=ws,
    params=FastAPIWebsocketParams(serializer=serializer, vad_enabled=True)
)
```

> ⚠️ `TwilioFrameSerializer` is NOT a full Pipecat transport — it's a serializer that sits on top of `FastAPIWebsocketTransport`. It auto-converts Twilio's **8kHz µ-law → 16kHz PCM** (Pipecat's working format) and back.

---

### 🥈 #2 — Plivo (or Exotel for India-native)

**What it does:**
Same core function as Twilio — PSTN outbound calls to candidates, audio streamed via WebSocket to your Pipecat server. Drop-in replacement via `PlivoFrameSerializer` or `ExotelFrameSerializer` in Pipecat.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Same PSTN outbound calling as Twilio
- ✅ WebSocket audio streaming (same pattern as Twilio)
- ✅ India data center (Bangalore) — lower latency for India calls
- ✅ Built-in TRAI compliance tools (especially Exotel)
- ✅ Pipecat serializer available (`PlivoFrameSerializer`, `ExotelFrameSerializer`)
- ✅ India toll-free number (1800) faster setup via Exotel vs Twilio
- ✅ 50–70% cheaper India outbound rates

**India pricing (Plivo):**

| Call Type | Rate/min |
|---|---|
| Outbound to India mobile | $0.004 – $0.012 |
| Outbound to India landline | $0.005 |
| India DID number | $1.00–1.50/month |

**Why choose Plivo/Exotel over Twilio:**
- Cost: 50–70% cheaper for India outbound — at 1,000 interviews/month this is significant
- Exotel is built specifically for Indian telecoms — handles TRAI registration, KYC, local compliance natively
- India DC means lower call latency from Indian networks

**Why Twilio is still #1:**
- More mature Pipecat tooling and examples
- Better global reach if interviews extend to non-India candidates
- More battle-tested reliability and documentation

**Code change to switch from Twilio to Plivo:** Only the serializer changes — pipeline stays identical.
```python
# Swap this line only:
from pipecat.serializers.plivo import PlivoFrameSerializer  # instead of TwilioFrameSerializer
```

## 3. STT — Speech to Text

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Sarvam Saaras v3 | Deepgram Nova-3 | Whisper | Google Chirp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hindi accuracy | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| Marathi accuracy | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| Code-switching (Hindi+Marathi+Eng) | ✅ Native `codemix` | ⚠️ `language=multi` (weak Marathi) | ❌ No real-time | ❌ No codemix |
| Latency from India | ~300ms (India DC) | **150–300ms** (US DC) | 500ms–1s | ~400ms |
| WER on Indian speech | ~19% (IndicVoices) | ~20–25% (India) | ~22%+ | ~18–22% |
| Pipecat native | ✅ `SarvamSTTService` | ✅ `DeepgramSTTService` | ✅ `WhisperSTTService` | ✅ `GoogleSTTService` |
| Pricing | ₹15/10K chars | Usage-based (US pricing) | Free (self-hosted) | $0.016/15sec |

---

### 🥇 #1 — Sarvam Saaras v3 (codemix mode)

**What it does:**
- Streams audio from the phone call → returns transcript in real-time
- `codemix` mode transcribes Hindi, Marathi, and English simultaneously, preserving each script exactly as spoken
- Runs from India servers — ~300ms latency vs 1,830ms for US-based endpoints

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Native Hindi/Marathi/English code-switching — no other provider has this
- ✅ Preserves Devanagari script for Hindi/Marathi words and Latin for English words
- ✅ India-local inference — ~952ms total E2E (including network) vs Deepgram's 1,830ms from India
- ✅ Real-time streaming (not batch) — word-by-word output while candidate still speaking
- ✅ Telephony-grade audio support (handles 8kHz µ-law from Twilio)
- ✅ Native Pipecat service (`SarvamSTTService`)
- ✅ WER ~19% on IndicVoices benchmark (~25–35% expected on real 8kHz phone audio — normal for telephony)

**The unique advantage — `codemix` output:**
```
Input speech:  "मेरे पास 5 years का experience है in Python"
Saaras output: "मेरे पास 5 years का experience है in Python"
                ↑ Devanagari preserved              ↑ Latin preserved
```
GPT-4o receives the transcript exactly as the candidate spoke it — no translation or script normalization.

**Setup:**
```python
pip install "pipecat-ai[sarvam]"
```
```python
from pipecat.services.sarvam.stt import SarvamSTTService

stt = SarvamSTTService(
    api_key=SARVAM_API_KEY,
    model="saaras:v3",
    mode="codemix"   # handles Hindi/Marathi/English mixing natively
)
```

> ⚠️ WER benchmarks (~19%) are from IndicVoices dataset. Real phone-call performance (8kHz µ-law) will be 25–35% WER — this is normal for telephone audio across all providers.

---

### 🥈 #2 — Deepgram Nova-3 (language=multi)

**What it does:**
Same role — real-time streaming STT from phone audio. Deepgram is US-based but is the fastest STT provider globally and has good Hindi support.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Fastest STT available — 150–300ms latency (though from US DC, round-trip from India adds ~200ms)
- ✅ Good Hindi accuracy
- ✅ `language=multi` flag supports multilingual input
- ✅ Very mature streaming API, widely used in production voice agents
- ✅ Native Pipecat service (`DeepgramSTTService`)
- ⚠️ Marathi support is partial — works for common phrases, struggles with regional accents
- ⚠️ No `codemix` mode — code-switched output may be inconsistent in script (sometimes transliterates Hindi to Latin)

**When to choose Deepgram over Sarvam:**
- Candidate speaks primarily English or Hinglish (no pure Hindi/Marathi speakers in your target pool)
- Sarvam downtime or rate limit issues — use Deepgram as fallback
- Absolute minimum latency is the top priority

```python
from pipecat.services.deepgram import DeepgramSTTService
from deepgram import LiveOptions

stt = DeepgramSTTService(
    api_key=DEEPGRAM_API_KEY,
    live_options=LiveOptions(model="nova-3", language="multi", smart_format=True)
)
```

| Cost (input / output tokens) | $2.50 / $10 per 1M | $3 / $15 per 1M | $1.25 / $5 per 1M |

---

### 🥇 #1 — GPT-4o (128K context, gpt-4o)

**What it does:**
- Receives the full conversation history (`messages[]`) + system prompt (job description, candidate resume, scoring rubric)
- Generates the next interview question, follow-up, or clarifying probe
- At session end: generates a structured evaluation JSON (scores, reasoning, recommendation)

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ 128K context window — holds entire 45-min multilingual interview with 3–4× headroom
- ✅ Streaming output — starts generating before full response is ready (reduces TTFA)
- ✅ Excellent structured JSON output via `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` — critical for scoring rubrics
- ✅ Strong instruction following — follows complex interview rubrics and branching logic
- ✅ Good comprehension of code-switched Hindi/Marathi/English transcripts
- ✅ Best-documented Pipecat integration (`OpenAILLMService`) with most community examples
- ✅ Function calling — can trigger structured scoring mid-interview if needed

**Setup:**
```python
from pipecat.services.openai import OpenAILLMService
from pipecat.processors.aggregators.openai_llm_context import OpenAILLMContext

llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model="gpt-4o")
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]  # system_prompt has JD + rubric
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages)
context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)
```

**Why GPT-4o is #1:**
- Most mature Pipecat tooling with `OpenAILLMService`
- Most community examples for voice agent use cases
- Proven structured output reliability at production scale

---

### 🥈 #2 — Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)

**What it does:**
Same role as GPT-4o — the interviewer brain. Near-identical output quality for interview tasks.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ 200K context window — 50% larger than GPT-4o; more headroom for very long sessions or extra context
- ✅ Widely considered slightly better at nuanced instruction following and rubric adherence
- ✅ Strong structured output
- ✅ Good comprehension of multilingual code-switched input
- ✅ Native Pipecat service (`AnthropicLLMService`)
- ⚠️ Slightly higher first-token latency (~300–600ms vs GPT-4o's ~200–500ms)
- ⚠️ Less Pipecat community examples than GPT-4o

**When to choose Claude over GPT-4o:**
- Your interview rubrics are very complex (multi-level branching, detailed follow-up logic) — Claude's instruction following may be marginally better
- Interviews regularly exceed 90 minutes and you need the larger 200K window
- You want to compare quality in an A/B test after building on GPT-4o first

```python
from pipecat.services.anthropic import AnthropicLLMService

llm = AnthropicLLMService(api_key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
```

## 5. TTS — Voice Output

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Sarvam Bulbul v2 | ElevenLabs Flash v2 | Google WaveNet | Azure Neural TTS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hindi voice quality | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| Marathi voice quality | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★☆☆ |
| Indian accent authenticity | ✅ Native Indian | ✅ Good (global-trained) | ✅ Good | ✅ Good |
| Code-mixed output (Hinglish) | ✅ Natural | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial |
| Latency (first audio byte) | ~300–500ms | **75–300ms** (Flash) | ~400ms | ~350ms |
| Cost | ₹15/10K chars (~$0.18) | $0.11/1K chars (expensive) | $0.004/char | $0.004/char |
| Pipecat native | ✅ `SarvamTTSService` | ✅ `ElevenLabsTTSService` | ✅ `GoogleTTSService` | ✅ `AzureTTSService` |
| Streaming | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

---

### 🥇 #1 — Sarvam Bulbul v2

**What it does:**
- Takes the LLM's text response → generates Hindi/English/Marathi speech audio
- Streams audio chunks back through Twilio to the candidate's phone
- Bulbul v2 is purpose-trained on Indian speech — sounds natural to Indian candidates

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Native Hindi and Marathi TTS — purpose-trained on Indian speech patterns, not globally trained
- ✅ Handles code-mixed text naturally ("आपका experience kya है?") without pronunciation errors
- ✅ Regional accent variants — Mumbai, Delhi, Pune-flavored voices available
- ✅ Streaming support — audio starts playing before full text is generated
- ✅ Multiple voice profiles: professional, conversational, formal
- ✅ Native Pipecat service (`SarvamTTSService`)
- ✅ India-local inference — lower latency vs US-based TTS

**Why Bulbul is #1 for phone interviews:**
- Phone calls run at 8kHz µ-law (telephone quality) — this naturally caps perceived audio fidelity. An expensive, high-quality TTS voice is partially "wasted" on a phone call. Bulbul's quality is more than sufficient for this channel.
- Indian candidates will find Bulbul's accent more natural and relatable than a globally-trained voice
- 5–10× cheaper than ElevenLabs at the same audio quality level on phone

```python
from pipecat.services.sarvam.tts import SarvamTTSService

tts = SarvamTTSService(
    api_key=SARVAM_API_KEY,
    model="bulbul:v2",
    language="hi-IN",   # or "mr-IN" — switchable per-response
    voice="anila"        # professional female voice; options: anila, meera, etc.
)
```

---

### 🥈 #2 — ElevenLabs Flash v2

**What it does:**
Same role — TTS from LLM text output. ElevenLabs is the gold standard for voice quality globally.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Best voice quality globally — most natural, human-like output of any TTS provider
- ✅ Flash v2 has 75–300ms TTFA — fastest TTS available (vs Bulbul's 300–500ms)
- ✅ Hindi support (good quality, though not India-regional-accent specific)
- ✅ Voice cloning — can clone a specific voice if you want a branded interviewer persona
- ✅ Native Pipecat service (`ElevenLabsTTSService`)
- ⚠️ Marathi support is limited
- ⚠️ Most expensive TTS option — $0.11/1K chars vs Bulbul's ₹15/10K chars
- ⚠️ US-based endpoint — adds ~150–200ms round-trip from India vs Bulbul's India-local

**When to choose ElevenLabs over Bulbul:**
- Premium voice quality is the top priority (e.g., high-value executive interviews, not mass screening)
- You want voice cloning to give the AI agent a distinct brand identity
- TTS latency is the bottleneck and you need Flash v2's speed (check after profiling the real pipeline)

```python
from pipecat.services.elevenlabs import ElevenLabsTTSService

## 6. VAD — Voice Activity Detection

### Decision: ✅ Silero VAD (built into Pipecat)

Silero VAD detects when the candidate **starts** and **stops** speaking on the phone call. This is what prevents the AI from talking over the candidate and ensures natural turn-taking.

```python
from pipecat.audio.vad.silero import SileroVADAnalyzer

vad = SileroVADAnalyzer()
# Pipecat integrates this automatically with transport input
```

- **Cost**: Free (runs locally, open-source)
- **Latency added**: ~20–50ms
- **Accuracy**: Production-grade for phone-quality audio
- **No alternative needed** — Silero is the standard for Pipecat voice agents

> ⚠️ **Not yet researched**: VAD fine-tuning for phone call characteristics — phone calls introduce different noise floors and acoustic artifacts vs WebRTC. Silero handles this well in general, but specific threshold tuning for 8kHz Twilio audio may be needed in production.

## 7. Memory & Context Management

### 7.1 Within a Single 45-Minute Interview

**No special tooling needed.** GPT-4o's 128K context window handles the full session natively.

**Token math:**
```
45-min multilingual interview ≈ 20,000–35,000 tokens
GPT-4o limit: 128,000 tokens → ~3–4× headroom. Limit hit at ~66 min of Hindi/Marathi.
```

Pipecat automatically manages the `messages[]` array — every turn is appended and passed to GPT-4o on each request.

```python
# Pipecat manages context automatically — no extra setup needed
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages)
context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)
```

> ⚠️ **"Lost in the middle" problem**: LLMs recall information at the start and end of context better than the middle. Mitigate with a running `interview_notes` JSON object in the system prompt that gets updated each turn with key facts extracted.

---

### 7.2 Cross-Round Memory (Round 1 → Round 2)

This is where specialized memory tooling helps. Round 2's agent needs to know what happened in Round 1 without replaying the full 45-min transcript.

### Cross-Round Comparison

| Feature | Mem0 | Supermemory | PostgreSQL + pgvector |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pipecat native | ✅ `Mem0MemoryService` | ✅ `SupermemoryService` | ❌ Manual setup |
| Semantic search | ✅ Vector similarity | ✅ Vector similarity | ✅ (if pgvector) |
| Automatic injection | ✅ Into system prompt | ✅ Into system prompt | ❌ Manual |
| User/session scoping | ✅ `user_id` + `run_id` | ✅ `user_id` + `space_id` | ✅ Custom SQL |
| Long-term profiles | ✅ Good | ✅ `profile` mode (better) | ✅ Custom |
| Self-hosted option | ❌ Cloud only | ❌ Cloud only | ✅ Full control |

---

### 🥇 #1 Cross-Round Memory — Mem0

**What it does:**
- After Round 1 ends: automatically extracts and stores key facts ("Python expert, 5 years, Infosys, weak on system design")
- Before Round 2 starts: retrieves and injects those memories into the GPT-4o system prompt
- Uses semantic vector search — Round 2 can query "leadership experience" and find relevant memories even if Round 1 used different words

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Native Pipecat integration — drop into pipeline with no extra backend code
- ✅ Semantic search retrieval — not just keyword matching, meaning-based
- ✅ Scoped by `user_id` (candidate) + `run_id` (interview round) — clean separation
- ✅ Auto-injects retrieved memories into system prompt as a system message
- ✅ Works across interview rounds weeks or months apart
- ✅ Managed cloud service — no vector DB infrastructure to run

```python
pip install "pipecat-ai[mem0]"
```
```python
from pipecat.services.mem0 import Mem0MemoryService

memory = Mem0MemoryService(
    api_key=MEM0_API_KEY,
    user_id=candidate_id,         # same candidate across all rounds
    run_id=f"round_{round_num}",  # unique per session
    params={"search_limit": 10, "add_as_system_message": True}
)
# Pipeline: stt → context_aggregator.user() → memory → llm → tts
```

**What Mem0 does automatically:**
- After Round 1: saves "Python 5 years, Infosys, weak system design, strong communication"
- Before Round 2: injects those facts into GPT-4o's context → Round 2 interviewer is pre-informed

---

### 🥈 #2 Cross-Round Memory — Supermemory

**What it does:**
Same role as Mem0 — cross-round memory retrieval and injection. Supermemory has a `profile` mode that maintains a persistent candidate profile that evolves across all rounds.

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Native Pipecat integration (`SupermemoryService`)
- ✅ `profile` mode — builds a growing candidate profile across all interactions (better for 3+ round interviews)
- ✅ `space_id` for organizing memories by project/job role
- ✅ Semantic vector search retrieval
- ✅ Auto-injection into system prompt
- ⚠️ Less community examples in Pipecat context than Mem0

**When to choose Supermemory over Mem0:**
- 3+ interview rounds and you want a rich evolving candidate profile
- Need to organize memories by job role or department (`space_id`)
- Want a candidate profile that persists indefinitely (e.g., re-interview same candidate 6 months later)

```python
pip install "pipecat-ai[supermemory]"
```
```python
from pipecat.services.supermemory import SupermemoryService

memory = SupermemoryService(
    api_key=SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY,
    user_id=candidate_id,
    space_id=f"job_{job_role_id}",  # organize by role
    params={"search_limit": 10}
)
```

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ Interview ends (45 min)

```

**Minimal Pipecat code:**
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),
    silero_vad,
    sarvam_stt,
    context_aggregator.user(),
    mem0_memory,            # only for multi-round
    gpt4o_llm,
    sarvam_tts,
    transport.output(),
    context_aggregator.assistant(),
])
```

---

## 9. Latency Budget

```
Candidate finishes speaking
        ↓  ~20ms    Silero VAD: detects end of speech
        ↓  ~300ms   Sarvam Saaras v3: transcribes audio (India endpoint)
        ↓  ~300ms   GPT-4o: generates first token (streaming)
        ↓  ~400ms   Sarvam Bulbul v2: first audio chunk
        ↓  ~150ms   Twilio: delivers audio to candidate's phone
        ↓
     Total ≈ 1.2 – 2.2 seconds
```

This is within the natural conversational pause range for a **phone interview** (humans pause 1–3 seconds between turns). Candidates will not notice this as unnatural.

---

## 10. Cost Estimate (Per Interview Session)

Assuming: 45-minute multilingual interview, ~3 turns/minute = ~135 turns

| Component | Cost/session | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Twilio outbound call (India) | $0.61 – $4.10 | 45 min × $0.0135–$0.091/min |
| Sarvam Saaras v3 STT | ~₹3–5 (~$0.04–0.06) | ~135 turns × ~300 chars × ₹15/10K |
| GPT-4o LLM | ~$0.10 – $0.25 | ~20K tokens × $5–15/1M tokens |
| Sarvam Bulbul v2 TTS | ~₹2–4 (~$0.02–0.05) | ~135 responses × ~200 chars × ₹15/10K |
| **Total/session** | **~$0.75 – $4.50** | Twilio dominates; Plivo halves it |

> 💡 Switching Twilio → Plivo reduces the telephony cost by ~50–70%, making the total closer to **$0.40 – $2.00/session** for India outbound.

## 11. What's Not Yet Researched

| Topic | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM benchmark for interviews** | 🔴 High | GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5 for interview question quality, evaluation accuracy |
| **VAD tuning for phone audio** | 🔴 High | 8kHz Twilio audio characteristics, silence thresholds, barge-in handling |
| **Interview prompt engineering** | 🔴 High | System prompt structure for structured interviews, follow-up logic |
| **Scoring & evaluation design** | 🟡 Medium | Rubric design, structured output schema, scoring consistency |
| **Deployment & scaling** | 🟡 Medium | Docker, concurrent Twilio calls, pipeline resource limits |
| **Error handling** | 🟡 Medium | Twilio disconnects, STT failures, LLM timeouts mid-interview |
